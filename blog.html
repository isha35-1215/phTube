        <h2>Discuss the scope of var, let, and const.</h1>
        <p>In JavaScript, var, let, and const are three different ways to declare variables, each with its own scope and
            behavior. Understanding the scope of these variable declarations is crucial for writing reliable and
            maintainable code. Let's discuss the scope of each:
            <ol>
                <li>var: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>var has function-level scope: Variables declared with var are function-scoped, which means they are only accessible within the function in which they are declared.</li>
                        <li>Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their containing function or global scope. This means that the variable declaration is moved to the top of its enclosing function during compilation, so you can use the variable before it's declared in code (though its value will be undefined until the actual declaration).</li>
                        <li>If you declare a var variable outside of any function, it becomes a global variable and is accessible throughout the entire script.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li>let: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            let has block-level scope: Variables declared with let are block-scoped, which means they are only accessible within the nearest enclosing block (usually denoted by curly braces {}) where they are defined.
                        </li>
                        <li>Variables declared with let are not hoisted to the top of their block, so you cannot use them before their declaration within the block.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li>const: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>const also has block-level scope: Variables declared with const are block-scoped, just like let.</li>
                        <li>The key difference with const is that it declares a constant variable, which means its value cannot be reassigned after it's initialized. However, for objects and arrays declared with const, the properties or elements of the object or array can be modified, but the reference to the object or array itself cannot be changed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h2>Tell the use cases of null and undefined.</h1>
        <p>In JavaScript, null and undefined are two distinct values that are often used in different contexts for specific purposes. Understanding their use cases is essential for writing clean and bug-free code:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    null:
                    <ul>
                        <li>null is a special value that represents the intentional absence of any object value or no value at all.</li>
                        <li>It is often used when you want to explicitly indicate that a variable or property should have no value.</li>
                        <li>Common use cases for null include:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Initializing variables or properties that are expected to hold an object reference but have no initial value.
                                </li>
                                <li>As a return value to indicate the absence of a meaningful result or when a function or method fails to produce a valid result.</li>
                                <li>As a placeholder value in data structures and algorithms.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    undefined:
                    <ul>
                        <li>undefined is a primitive value in JavaScript that indicates a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value. It's also the default value for function parameters that are not provided when the function is called.</li>
                        <li>Common use cases for undefined include:
                            <ul>
                                <li>When a variable is declared but not initialized.</li>
                                <li>As the default value for function parameters.
                                </li>
                                <li>As the value of an object property that has not been defined.</li>
                                <li>To check if a variable has been defined or assigned a value.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

        <h2>What do you mean by REST API?</h1>
        <p>REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It is a set of architectural principles and constraints for designing and structuring web services or APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that are used for communication between client and server applications over the internet. REST is not a specific technology or protocol but rather a design style or architectural pattern. <br>

            Key characteristics and principles of RESTful APIs include: <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Statelessness: <br> Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server should not rely on any information from previous requests. This enhances scalability and simplifies server implementation.</li><br>
                <li>Client-Server Architecture: <br> REST separates the client and server components, allowing them to evolve independently. This separation improves scalability and flexibility.</li><br>
                <li>Resource-Based: <br>  In REST, resources (such as data objects or services) are identified by unique URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). These resources can represent entities like users, products, or any other data or service.</li><br>
                <li>HTTP Methods: <br>  RESTful APIs typically use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to perform operations on resources. Each HTTP method has a specific meaning:
                    <ul>
                        <li>GET: Retrieve a resource or collection of resources.</li>
                        <li>POST: Create a new resource.</li>
                        <li>PUT: Update an existing resource or create one if it doesn't exist.</li>
                        <li>DELETE: Remove a resource.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li>Stateless Communication:  <br> The communication between the client and server is stateless, meaning that each request from the client to the server should contain all the information needed for processing. Server-side state is not retained between requests.</li><br>
                <li>Representation: <br>  Resources can have multiple representations, such as JSON, XML, or HTML. Clients can specify their preferred representation using the Accept header in the request.</li><br>
                <li>Uniform Interface: <br>  A uniform and consistent interface simplifies interactions between clients and servers. This includes consistent naming conventions, such as using nouns for resources and standard HTTP methods.</li><br>
                <li>Layered System:  <br> REST allows for a layered system architecture, where different components (e.g., load balancers, caching, security) can be added to the API infrastructure without affecting the client.</li><br>
                <li>Stateless Communication: <br>  RESTful interactions are stateless, meaning that each request from the client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. Server-side state is not retained between requests.</li><br>
                <li>Caching: <br>  Caching can be employed to improve performance and reduce server load. Responses from the server can include cache-control directives to instruct clients on how to cache responses.</li><br>
            </ol>
<br>
            RESTful APIs have become popular due to their simplicity, scalability, and ease of use. They are widely used in web development, allowing different applications and services to communicate with each other over HTTP in a standardized way. Common use cases include web services, mobile app backends, and integration with third-party services.
